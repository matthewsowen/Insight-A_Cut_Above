### A Cut Above: Finding the Sharpest Surgeon

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the code used to build a model that classifies lung surgeons based on their predicted rate of negative surgical outcomes. The model was constructed using data scraped from several public websites and the class designations that it output were incorporated into a web app that allows users to search for lung surgeons in their local area.
